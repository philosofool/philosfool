This is stuff I'm sharing, non-code version.

## Tight5

A thing where friends of mine and I share music we're digging at the moment. You get five songs.

### Round 3

Pick 5 songs from any single year. 

ME: Too easy.

#### 1959

Normally, I go for stuff that's a little more off the beaten path. But you could also just pick the most recognizable song from five jazz all-time great jazz albums and nail this. So that's what I did. 

Tumpet: Miles Davis. So What?, _Kind of Blue_ (1959)
Piano: Dave Brubeck. Take Five, _Time Out_ (1959)
Drums: Art Blakey. Moanin', _Moanin'_ (1959)
Bass: Charles Mingues. Better Get Hit in your Soul, _Mingus Ah Uhm_ (1959)
Sax: Ornette Coleman. Lonely Woman, _The Shape of Jazz to Come_ (1959)
