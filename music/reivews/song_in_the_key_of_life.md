# Songs in the Key of Life, Stevie Wonder (1976)

Songs in the Key of Life (Stevie Wonder, 1976) delivers on the promise of its title.
Wonder is a skilled instrumentalist, a great vocalist, and--on the strength of this album alone--
one of the best composers in the history of popular music.
If you know Stevie Wonder from his hit songs, as I formerly did,
you might expect Songs in the Key of Life to be a celebration of living,
but a little too easy, avoidant of life's sad or complex keys.
It is a celebration of living.
As though to fulfill the promise of the album's joyous "Sir Duke,"
Wonder explores facets of human experience in joyous, upbeat nostalgia ("I Wish"),
mournful contemplations ("If It's Magic") and
layered R&B tours de force that defy pinning to a single emotion or idea ("As").

There are songs that could reach the top of whatever metrics Spotify is using at this moment.
If you released it tomorrow on a musical world that had never experienced it,
the masterful R&B riffing and irresistable hook of "All Day Sucker"
could seduce a generation that's never fully listened to an album.

There's more than one bad lyric turned into good music by Wonder's great voice and skilled phrasing.
If there are weaknesses in here it's that you shouldn't repeat the lyrics as prose.
Even in this regard, though, it's easy to see the album foreshadowing the next phase of Black American music
(which is to say, American music):
how many rap songs succeed on rythmic insights that turn an otherwise blundered rhyme into a catching phrase?

Among complex synonyms of "uh oh" you might include "mid-career double album."
But there are no true mistakes in "Songs in the Key of Life."
It's a gem of popular music: catchy and accessible, nuanced and moving, composed, free and spectacular.


Rolling Stone placed this album No. 4 in it's all-time album list; Apple placed it No. 7.
It's a just placement.
